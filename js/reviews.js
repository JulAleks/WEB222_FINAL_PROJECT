      revBod: "Our family adores this classic game! We have cherished memories of playing Taki during our childhood, and now we continue the tradition with our kids since they were around 4 years old. We sometimes modify the rules, like removing the +3 and broken 3 cards or dealing a different number of cards at the start. The tournament version adds an extra level of excitement too!",
